2) Set your username/password for the database an site on the src/clj_record_blog/config/db.clj

    # config/db.clj
    (def *user-name* "<site-username>")
    (def *password* "<site-password>")

    (def *db-host* "localhost")
    (def *db-port* 3306)
    (def *db-name* "<db-name>")
    (def *db-user* "<db-username>")
    (def *db-password* "<db-password>")

3) Install project's dependencies.

  $ lein deps

4) Create database schema

  $ lein repl
  user=> (use 'clj-record-blog.db.migrate)
  nil
  user=> (create-blog)
  (0)
  user=>
  [Ctrl+D] (to exit from REPL)
